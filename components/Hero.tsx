                Hi It's RM Shah, a creative web designer and practicing lawyer with a strong drive for crafting impactful designs.
                 With Master’s degrees in Economics and Political Science, 
                 I’ve developed a unique perspective that blends deep analysis with creativity. 
                 As I explore AI, I’m constantly challenging myself to learn and grow. 
                 Beyond my technical work, I’m a dedicated scholar, 
                 passionate about gaining knowledge in various fields. 
                 My projects reflect my commitment to both aesthetics and strategy, 
                 resulting in designs that are not only beautiful but also thoughtful and effective.
                </p>
